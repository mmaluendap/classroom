/***************************************************
 * This is a SPI library for the ATMega328P.
 *
 * It can provide basic SPI master functionality for any application, but is
 * directly targeted at the Adafruit 1.8" SPI display and its SD card socket.
 * 
 * It is based on example codes from the Atmel device datasheet. The code is
 * kept simple, but is not always efficient. It is an easy-to-understand example
 * for studies and not intended for productive use.
 *
 * This code is in the public domain. Feel free to do with it whatever you want.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * FOR STUDENTS:
 * 
 * This file will be given to you in an 'empty' state. The function bodies are
 * provided, but not their content. You are supposed to add the proper setup
 * code and complete these functions.
 * 
 * Hint 1: RTFM! The Atmel device datasheets contain all information necessary.

// The initialisation function. Call it once from your main() program before
// issuing any SPI commands with the functions below!
//
// Hint: It shoud activate the according SPI module in the microcontroller and
// probably set some register values. SPI has many options to configure! Read
// about them and find out, which ones are to be used here. Understanding the
// datasheets will be much faster than a simple try and error approach.
//
// Also note that <avr/io.h> and other files provide convenient macros for most
// registers and their bits. Stuff like
//    EXPL = (1<<POS)|(1<<FOO);
// is much nicer to read than
//    EXPL = 0b10010;
// This is not a requirement, but it will make life easier for you and your
// supervisors.

// This is very easy and short if you understood how SPI works.
